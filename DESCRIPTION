Title: Robust Analysis of MicroArrays
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Raphael Gottardo
Description: Robust estimation of cDNA microarray intensities with
        replicates. The package uses a Bayesian hierarchical model for
        the robust estimation. Outliers are modeled explicitly using a
        t-distribution, and the model also addresses classical issues
        such as design effects, normalization, transformation, and
        nonconstant variance.
